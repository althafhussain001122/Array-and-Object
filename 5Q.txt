Hereâ€™s how you can create the displayStudentInfo function using a for...in loop to iterate over the properties of a student object and print each property with its corresponding value:

for...in loop: Loops through each property in the student object.
student.hasOwnProperty(key): Ensures that only the object's own properties (not inherited ones) are printed.
console.log(): Prints the property name (key) and its value (student[key]).

PROGRAM:
// Function to display student information
function displayStudentInfo(student) {
  console.log('Student Information:');
  for (let key in student) {
    if (student.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      console.log(`${key}: ${student[key]}`);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage of displayStudentInfo
const student = {
  id: 101,
  firstName: 'Alex',
  lastName: 'Johnson',
  age: 22,
  grade: 'A',
  major: 'Computer Science'
};

displayStudentInfo(student);

Expected Output:

Student Information:
id: 101
firstName: Alex
lastName: Johnson
age: 22
grade: A
major: Computer Science
